## Jarník Example

Order of addition: KH KJ JI IF FC FG FE GD DB DA

![](../images/wtgraph.png)

## Jarník Description and Time

Use a priority queue that does `DecreaseKey`, `Insert`, and `ExtractMin` each in $O(V)$ time.

```
Jarník(G):
  pick random vertex v
  T <- graph containing just v
  Insert all neighboring edges into priority queue (key = weight)
  while the priority queue is not empty:
    ExtractMin edge uv
    if uv is unmarked and u and v are not both in T:
      mark uv
      add uv to T
      for each unmarked edge neighboring u and v
        Insert edge (key = weight)
```

- Each edge gets marked once, so there are $O(E)$ `ExtractMin` and `Insert`'s.
- Time $O(E \log E)$.
- Recall that $O(E \log E) = O(E \log V)$ since $E \in O(V^2)$.

## Another Jarník Description

```
JarnikTree(G, start_vertex):
  tree = Tree()
  active_edges = PriorityQueue()
  add G[start_vertex].edges to active_edges (sorted by edge weight)
  while tree.node_count != G.node_count:
    safe = pop from active_edges
    if G[safe] in tree: continue
    add G[safe] to tree
    add G[safe].edges to active_edges (sorted by edge weight)
  return tree
```

- See also Figure 7.5 (and just use a binary heap)

## Adjacency Matrix Example

    A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K 
A   0   7   0  3.2  0   0   0   0   0   0   0

K   0   0   0   0   0   0   0  4.7 6.2 5.3  0
```

## Adjacency Matrix Jarník description/time

```
// s is starting vertex
// M is adjancency matrix
Jarnik(M[V,V],s):
  T <-({s},∅)
  neighbors <- []
  neighbors.add(s)
  while neighbors is not empty
    for each e ∈ neighbors
      min <- infinity
        for i <- 1 to |V|
          if M[e,i] != 0 and M[e,i] < min
            min <- M[e,i]
            newNeighbor <- i
        add newNeighbor to T
    neighbors.add(newNeighbor)
  return T
```

Time: $O(V^3)$


# Shortest Paths

## Shortest Paths, SSSP

- Now we consider **directed**, **weighted** graphs with *positive* weights.
- The natural problem is how to get from one vertex to another following the directed path of least weight.
    - e.g., transportation optimization, network routing, LaTeX line breaking, Rubik's Cube, etc.
- Finding the shortest path from $s$ to $f$ usually means we have to find the shortest path from $s$ to everything.
    - Find the **SSSP Tree.**
        - Similar to Breadth-First spanning tree, but with weights.

## Tentative Shortest Paths and Predecessors

- $s$ is the start vertex.
- $s \rightsquigarrow v$ is the **tentative shortest path** from $s$ to $v$.
- $\text{dist}(v)$ is the **weight** of the tentative shortest path $s \rightsquigarrow v$.
- $\text{pred}(v)$ is the **predecessor** of $v$ in $s \rightsquigarrow v$.

We find the shortest path by updating the tentative shortest paths until we can't make them any better.

## Tense edges

- $\text{dist}(v)$ is the *weight* of the tentative shortest path $s \rightsquigarrow v$.
- $\text{pred}(v)$ is the *predecessor* of $v$ in $s \rightsquigarrow v$.

An edge $u\rightarrow v$ is called **tense** if $\text{dist}(u) + w(u\rightarrow v) < \text{dist}(v)$.

- So we can improve things by going through $u\rightarrow v$. (**relax**ing)
- That is, replace the tentative $s \rightsquigarrow v$ with $s \rightsquigarrow u \rightarrow v$, and update $\text{dist}(v)$ and $\text{pred}(v)$.

## SSSP by Repeated Relaxing: Meta-Algorithm

```
InitSSSP(s):                          Relax(uv):
    dist(s) <- 0                          dist(v) <- dist(u) + w(uv)
    pred(s) <- Null                       pred(v) <- u
    for all vertices v != s
        dist(v) <- Infinity
        pred(v) ← Null
        
MetaSSSP(s):
    InitSSSP(s)
    while there is at least one tense edge      // NOTE: need to specify how to check
        Relax any tense edge                    // NOTE: need to specify how to choose
```



## Table Groups

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
roster <- c("Ethan", "Talia", "Drake", "Jack", "Andrew", "Blake", "Jordan", "Graham", "Kevin", "Logan", "Claire", "Bri", "Trevor", "James", "Kristen", "Levi", "Grace", "John", "Isaac", "Josiah", "Nathan")
set.seed(3302021) 
n <- length(roster)
ngps <- 7
maxingp <- ceiling(n/ngps)
# just make random groups
groups <- matrix(c(roster[sample(n)], 
                   rep("",(maxingp - (n %% maxingp)) %% maxingp)), 
                 ncol=maxingp, byrow=FALSE)
rownames(groups) <- paste0("Table #", 1:nrow(groups))
kable(t(groups))
```

## Find the SSSP Tree: Jamboard

Starting at the leftmost vertex $s$, apply repeated `Relax`ings to produce the SSSP tree for the given graph. Make note of a relaxing that you do where none of the distances are $\infty$.

# Variations

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Use a priority queue that does `DecreaseKey`, `Insert`, and `ExtractMin` each in $O(V)$ time.
    - The vertices go in the priority queue.
    - The key for vertex $v$ is $\text{dist}(v)$.
    - Starting with $s$, process the smallest edge and loop.

```
DijkstraSSSP(s):
    InitSSSP(s)
    for all vertices v
        Insert(v, dist(v))
    while the priority queue is not empty
        u <- ExtractMin()
        for all edges uv
            if uv is tense
                Relax(uv)
                DecreaseKey(v, dist(v))
```

(See Figure 8.12)

## Jamboard

Step through `DijkstraSSSP` on the Jamboard. Keep track of each `Relax` call (which edge gets relaxed, and in which order). 

## Dijkstra running time

```
DijkstraSSSP(s):
    InitSSSP(s)
    for all vertices v
        Insert(v, dist(v))
    while the priority queue is not empty
        u <- ExtractMin()
        for all edges uv
            if uv is tense
                Relax(uv)
                DecreaseKey(v, dist(v))
```

- `DecreaseKey`, `Insert`, and `ExtractMin` are all $O(\log V)$.
- At most $E$ `DecreaseKey`, at most $V$ `Insert`, and `ExtractMin`.
- Graphs are connected, so $E$ is "bigger" than $V$.
- Total time: $O(E \log V)$

## Bellman-Ford

- Relax *all* the tense edges, and recurse.
- Use an array `dist[]` to store the distances for each vertex.

```
BellmanFordSSSP(s)
    dist[s] <- 0
    for every vertex v != s
        dist[v] <- Infinity
    for i <- 1 to V − 1
        for every edge uv
            if dist[v] > dist[u] + w(uv)
                dist[v] <- dist[u] + w(uv)
```

Time: $O(VE)$
