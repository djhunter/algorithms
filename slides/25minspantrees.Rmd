# Trees

## Tree: Definition and equvalent notions

A **tree** is a *connected*, *acyclic* graph. (By default, a generic tree is *undirected*.) Equivalently,

- *Unique paths:* A tree is an undirected graph $T$ such that, for any two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $T$, there is a unique path from $u$ to $v$.
- *$V-1$ edges:* A tree is a connected, undirected graph with $V-1$ edges.
    - *Can't add an edge:* Adding an edge to a tree makes a cycle.

## Minimum Spanning Tree of a Weighted Graph

- A graph is called *weighted* if there is an assignment of real numbers (weights) to the edges.  
- Given a weighted graph $G$, a **minimum spanning tree** $T$ is a subgraph of $G$ such that:
    - $T$ contains all the vertices of $G$, and
    - The sum of weights of the edges of $T$ is as small as possible.
- [Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree#Applications): network optimization, image recognition, data analysis, etc.

(See Jamboard from last time.)

## Table Groups

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
roster <- c("Ethan", "Talia", "Drake", "Jack", "Andrew", "Blake", "Jordan", "Graham", "Kevin", "Logan", "Claire", "Bri", "Trevor", "James", "Kristen", "Levi", "Grace", "John", "Isaac", "Josiah", "Nathan")
set.seed(3222021) 
n <- length(roster)
ngps <- 7
maxingp <- ceiling(n/ngps)
# just make random groups
groups <- matrix(c(roster[sample(n)], 
                   rep("",(maxingp - (n %% maxingp)) %% maxingp)), 
                 ncol=maxingp, byrow=FALSE)
rownames(groups) <- paste0("Table #", 1:nrow(groups))
kable(t(groups))
```

## Smallest edge

1. Let $G$ be a weighted graph with an edge $e$ that is lighter than all the other edges. Prove that any minimum spanning tree must contain $e$.

Hints: 

- Suppose to the contrary that $T$ is a minimum spanning tree of $G$ and that ___________________.
- What happens is you add an edge to $T$?
- Show you can make a lighter spanning tree (contradiction).

# Uniqueness

## Simplifying assumption: distinct weights

Without losing generality, we can *assume our edge weights are distinct.*

Why is this OK?

- In most applications, they are distinct.
- We could break ties by adding an insignificant $\varepsilon$ to a weight.
- We could break ties some other systematic way.
- Two floats are "never" equal (at least you shouldn't expect them to be).

```{r}
sqrt(3)^2 == 3
```

## Two minimum spanning trees?

Suppose a connected, weighted, undirected graph $G$ has *distinct edge weights* and *two minimum spanning trees* $T$ and $T'$.

>- Suppose to the contrary that $T \neq T'$. 
>    - Then there are edges in $T$ that are not in $T'$, and edges in $T'$ that are not in $T$. Let $e$ be the smallest of these edges.
>    - In other words, $e$ is the smallest edge in $(T\setminus T')\cup(T'\setminus T)$. 
>    - WLOG, $e\in T\setminus T'$.
>- Adding this edge to $T'$ creates a cycle in $T'$.
>    - One of the edges in this cycle is not in $T$.
>    - Exchange this edge for $e$, and you reduce the weight of $T'$, a contradiction.

## **The** minimum spanning tree

We have proved the following.

**Lemma.** If all the edge weights of a graph are distinct, then its minimum spanning tree is *unique*.

So we will henceforth refer to "the" minimum spanning tree of a graph.

# Edge Classification

## Intermediate spanning forests

- We can build a spanning tree by selecting edges.
- At each stage, we avoid cycles, so we have a forest (maybe not a tree).

An *intermediate spanning forest* of a weighted graph $G$ is a subgraph of the minimum spanning tree of $G$.

## Safe and Useless edges

For any intermediate spanning forest $F$ of a graph $G$,

- An edge of $G$ is **useless** if it is not an edge of $F$, but both its endpoints are in the same component of $F$.
- An edge of $G$ is **safe** if it is the minimum-weight edge with exactly one endpoint in some component of $F$.

## Example

In the following graph $G$, the bold edges form an intermediate spanning forest $F$.

## Safe and Useless

2. Identify all the safe edges and all the useless edges.

3. What happens if you add a useless edge to $F$?

4. Add all the safe edges to $F$. Is the resulting forest $F'$ still an intermediate spanning forest?

5. Repeat: Add all of the safe edges of $F'$ to $F'$, and continue. How will this process terminate?
