**Do Exercise 1abc** on page 123 of [E]. 

- For part (a), just show that the greedy algorithm for the target amount $455 uses more Dream-Dollar bills than the minimum possible (no need to write a small program).
- For part (b), give a description of your recursive algorithm as a recursive function (no need to analyze its running time).
- For part (c), follow the steps outlined in Section 3.4. Describe an iterative algorithm, and give its space and time. It should be at most polynomial time ($O(n^p)$ for some $p$).
