Edit the [RMarkdown source file](05rectreepractice.Rmd) for this assignment in RStudio. When you finish, Knit the file to HTML and upload the `.html` output to Canvas.

Do Problem 6 on page 49 of [E]. Draw your recursion trees on scratch paper, and don't bother trying to typeset them in this document. For each recurrence, you only need to include:

- The given formula for the recurrence,
- The first few terms of the sequence of row sums,
- The case of the "Master Theorem" that you are using, and
- The asymptotic solution to the recurrence.
