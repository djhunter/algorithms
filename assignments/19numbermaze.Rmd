Edit the [RMarkdown source file](19numbermaze.Rmd) for this assignment in RStudio. When you finish, Knit the file to HTML and upload the `.html` output to Canvas.

**Do Exercise 11 on p. 212 of [E].**

- Assume that the number maze is given you you as an array `M[1..n,1..n]` of positive integers.
- Describe your algorithm in the appropriate level of detail. (Section 0.5)
- Your function is supposed to return a number: the minimum number of moves required to solve the number maze. If the maze has no solution, return `NO SOLUTION`. (Pseudocode is never strongly typed!)
- Give the running time of your algorithm as an asymptotic estimate in terms of $n$, and give a reason for your choice.
