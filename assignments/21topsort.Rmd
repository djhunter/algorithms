Edit the [RMarkdown source file](21topsort.Rmd) for this assignment in RStudio. When you finish, Knit the file to HTML and upload the `.html` output to Canvas.

Recall to the following functions.

```
DFS(v, clock):
    mark v
    clock <- clock + 1; v.pre <- clock
    for each edge vw
        if w is unmarked
            w.parent <- v
            clock <- DFS(w, clock)
    clock <- clock + 1; v.post <- clock
    return clock
    
DFSAll(G):
    clock <- 0
    for all vertices v
        unmark v
    for all vertices v
        if v is unmarked
            clock <- DFS(v, clock)
            
TopologicalSort(G):
    Call DFSAll(G) to compute finishing times v.post for all v in G
    Return vertices in order of decreasing finishing times
```

## Lots of edges

1. Use the `igraph` library to draw a directed graph $G$ with the following properties:
    - $G$ has six vertices 1,2,3,4,5,6.
    - $G$ is a DAG.
    - Every topological sort of $G$ yields the topological order 1,2,3,4,5,6.
    - $G$ has the maximum number of possible directed edges, subject to the above conditions.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(igraph)

## TODO: draw G
## NOTE: when calling graph_from_adj_list(), you have to set
##       the mode parameter to "out" to get a directed graph:
##           graph_from_adj_list(..., mode="out")

```

## One-way cities

2. The streets in the center of Cozumel, Mexico, are all one-way streets. In such a city, the intersections form the vertices of a directed graph $G$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are connected by a directed edge if they are on the same block and you can drive from $u$ to $v$. (For example, there is directed edge connecting the intersections of Avenida Benito Juarez/Avenida 15 Sur and Avenida Benito Juarez/Avenida 20 Sur, but there is no directed edge between Avenida Benito Juarez/Avenida 15 Sur and Avenida Benito Juarez/Avenida 25 Sur, because you can get there via an intermediate intersection.)
    a. Suppose that $G$ is a directed graph representing the streets in the center of Cozumel, as shown in the above map. Explain why $G$ is not a DAG.
    b. Suppose that the city of Dagville is one-way city like Cozumel, but in Dagville, the graph $G$ representing its streets *is* a DAG. Moreover, in Dagville, vertex $a$ is the only source intersection, and vertex $z$ is the only sink. Explain why any directed path from $a$ to $z$ must follow a topological ordering.
    c. Describe an algorithm that returns the number of directed paths from $a$ to $z$ in Dagville's $G$, subject to the following conditions.
        - Your algorithm should call `ToplogicalSort(G)` as a subroutine.
        - Your algorithm should populate an array `P[1..n]`, which gives the number of directed paths from $a$ (vertex 1) to vertex $i$. Here $z$ is vertex $n$.
        - Your algorithm should run in $O(V+E)$ time.
