For the following problems, we are assuming that every graph has distinct edge weights.

1. Give an example of a weighted undirected graph that is not a tree, but whose minimum spanning tree contains the largest edge in the graph. (ASCII-art is fine, or you could use [`igraph`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44077403/show-edge-attributes-as-label-with-igraph).)




2. Let $G$ be a weighted, undirected graph. Prove that for any cycle in $G$, the minimum spanning tree *does not include* the largest edge in the cycle.




3. Prove or disprove: The minimum spanning tree of a weighted, undirected graph $G$ includes the smallest edge in *every* cycle in $G$.
