Edit the [RMarkdown source file](28dijkstra.Rmd) for this assignment in RStudio. When you finish, Knit the file to HTML and upload the `.html` output to Canvas.

1. Step through [Dijkstra's Algorithm](../slides/28sssp.html#/dijkstras-algorithm) and list the edges (identified by their weights) in the order in which they are `Relax`ed.

2. Do Exercise 1 (both parts) on page 297 of [E]. Note that, in both parts (a) and (b), your time estimates should be in terms of $n$, not in terms of $V$ and $E$.
