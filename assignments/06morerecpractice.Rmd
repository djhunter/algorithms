> 1. Do Problems 7j and 7k on page 49 of [E]. Draw your recursion trees on scratch paper, and don't bother trying to typeset them in this document. Since these recurrences are a little messy, just include the given formula for the recurrence, the case of the "Master Theorem" that you are using (along with a reason for your choice), and the asymptotic solution to the recurrence.



> 2. Do Problem 33a on page 62 of [E], and make sure that your algorithm finds $k$ in $O(\log n)$ time. (Use the divide and conquer paradigm.) In addition to describing your algorithm, give a recurrence for the number of list comparisons, and check that the solution to the recurrence is $O(\log n)$.
