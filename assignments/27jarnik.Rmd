1. Jarník's algorithm is described (roughly) in Section 7.4 of [E]. Step through this algorithm on the following graph, and record a list of the vertices of the minimum spanning tree in the order that they are added to $T$. Start at vertex $K$.

2. In Section 7.4 of [E], the book does not give a complete description of Jarník's algorithm, and it does not explain in detail where the running time calculation comes from. Use pseudocode to give a description of Jarník's algorithm, and explain why it runs in $O(E \log E) = O(E \log V)$ time. (Take into account the priority queue operations that you reviewed in [assignment #15, problem 4](15prefixcodes.html).)




3. Recall the *adjacency matrix* representation of a graph described on pp. 196-197 of [E]. In an adjacency matrix for a *weighted* graph, the weights are the entries of the matrix. A weight of zero means that the vertices have no edge between them. Give the adjacency matrix for the graph in problem #1.




4. Rewrite your description of Jarník's algorithm using an adjacency matrix representation (and *not* using a priority queue), and compute its running time.
